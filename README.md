# Student Enrollment Form
#### Title of the Project - Student Enrollment Form
#### Description - 
###### The Student Enrollment Form project is designed to streamline the process of recording and managing student data within a school database. The form, integrated with JsonPowerDB (JPDB), captures essential information such as Roll No, Full Name, Class, Birth Date, Address, and Enrollment Date. The Roll No serves as the primary key in the STUDENT-TABLE relation of the SCHOOL-DB database. The form employs an intuitive interface with dynamic functionality, allowing users to input data, validate for completeness, and store the information in the database seamlessly. The application also supports data modification through the Update button, while the Reset button facilitates the resetting of the form for subsequent data entry.
